These could involve things such as:

- Difficulties with accessing or participating in events,
- Issues with how the Club or its events are run,
- Suggestions for things we can do better, or
- Volunteering to help out with the club.

**You can get in touch with us through the following means**:

    If this is at an in-person event, they would have introduced themselves at the start.
    If this is on Discord, look out for someone with the purple AdminTeam role and send them a message.
