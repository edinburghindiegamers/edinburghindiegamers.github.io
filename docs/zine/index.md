# Zine

In 2021 we crowdfunded a zine to share games, art and articles by our community with the wider world. One of the things the zine funded was a website for our club.
This is that website!
We would love for you to read, print, enjoy, translate and generally consume our zine.
You can [download it for free on itch.io](https://empowermint.itch.io/edinburgh-indie-gamers-zine-2021).
