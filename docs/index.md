Edinburgh Indie Gamers is an inclusive tabletop gaming club dedicated to indie roleplaying and story games.

!!! question "What is an indie game?"

    We play small-press roleplaying games of the types which let players tell a story together.
    These are games not made by large, mainstream publishing companies.
    If you're not sure what any of this means, that's a sign you need to get stuck in and join us.
    (Don't worry, the water's lovely...)

    For more information on the kinds of games we play, see our [Welcome Guide](resources/welcome-guide.md#the-kind-of-games-we-play).
