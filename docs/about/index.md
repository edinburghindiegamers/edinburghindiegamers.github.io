## The Admin Team

Edinburgh Indie Gamers is run by a small team of volunteers who comprise its admin team.
There is a small group of about seven to ten of us who share the responsibility of managing the Club's money, venue bookings, and events.
We also moderate the Discord, maintain the website, and promote the club at conventions or events.
Members of the Admin Team also respond to any feedback, concerns, queries, or issues participants may have.
We do our best to help participants in the club enjoy their time here.

## The Zine

Our zine is also published by volunteers and a wide range of contributors within the Club.
There is no barrier to contribution, and we encourage any member of our community who is interested in sharing any kind of material, whether it is artwork, articles, games, or even contributing their skills with graphic design or copy editing, to get in touch!

## Getting Involved

We always welcome people who want to get involved in running the Club or publishing the Zine!
There is no formal application process.
If you are interested in volunteering, please get in touch with the Admin Team via the [Contact](../contact/index.md) page.
We do recommend that you take some time to come along to the Club first so you can get a feel for the club, its atmosphere, and its culture.
