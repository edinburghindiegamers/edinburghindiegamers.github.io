# General Club Rules

## Fees and Costs

All our in-person meets are **free to attend**.
However, as we meet at local venues, we encourage people to buy food or drinks where appropriate to support local businesses.

## Discord Membership

We really value our local community and want it to grow organically and sustainably.
This is why we restrict membership of our Discord.

Our Discord server is open to **adults** who either:

- Plan to come to our in-person events in Edinburgh, or
- Are former attendees now living further afield.

If you live in a populous area that does not have a local gaming club, we think you should start one!
Please help yourself to free copies of our zines, which contain advice for starting your own groups.

When you join the server you must accept our code of conduct to fully access the server.
Your username will go green once you have done this.
We encourage you to introduce yourself in the **#general-chat** channel.

## Coming Along for the First Time

We are a welcome and inclusive group, but we know coming along for the first time can be daunting.
We encourage newcomers to read our [Welcome Guide](../resources/welcome-guide.md)
If you have any additional needs, or would like a buddy to meet you to help you come along and enjoy yourself, please reach out to the admin team on Discord.

## Promotions and Demonstrations

EIG is a space dedicated to playing small press and indie games.
It is not a space for disconnected promotion and advertising.
While running your own games is encouraged, it is often considered bad form to do this to the exclusion of others.
Club members can post links in the **#crowdfunding-and-promotion** channel of our Discord server.

If you're not an existing part of our community and you rock up in order to post marketing material, we will treat this as spam and you will be removed.

## Online Events

Occasionally, we run online events via Discord or other such software.
However, this is infrequent and is not a focus of the Club.
You can get more information about this on our Discord.

## Private Games

Members of our club are encouraged to arrange their private games outside of the Club’s meets.
The Club cannot take responsibility for any issues that arise at private games.
Members should use their judgement when organising or participating in private games.
However, as these games are facilitated through the Club, we expect all such games to promote the same inclusive and welcoming play culture that is part of the Club’s values.

## Social Events

We try to run a pub social meetup every few months so folks can meet away from the gaming table.
If you would like to come along, check the events tab or just check for any chat in the channel.

## Handling Complaints or Concerns

We recognise that sometimes issues can arise with how our events and our Club run.
If you have any concerns or complaints you would like to raise, please get in touch with the Admin Team.
You can find more information on how to contact the Admin Team by following the link below:

[:material-message-text: Contact the Admin Team](../contact/index.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

The admin team will listen to any concerns members raise and will discuss with the member what steps the Club can take to address the issue going forward.

Where there are breaches of the Code of Conduct, we will investigate the matter and respond as highlighted in the Code.
Our priority is to make sure that we minimise harm to all participants.
If a member of the admin team is involved with the issue being raised, then they will not be involved in handling the incident.
