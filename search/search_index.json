These are not formal rules, but rather guidelines on what has worked for us over the years in ensuring games are enjoyable for all.</p> <ul> <li>Make communication a norm rather than just a problem-solving tool.   This takes the pressure off of using safety tools or having conversations about the game, and makes it feel less like a confrontation and more like part of the collaborative process.</li> <li>Communicate your boundaries and expectations clearly.   This includes giving a clear outline of what your game is going to be like and saying if there are some boundaries on content or behaviour you would like observed.   The safety tools and pitch template are there to facilitate these conversations.</li> <li>Respect your own and other people\u2019s boundaries.   Be sensitive to the boundaries other people set and don\u2019t cross them.   Also, if you feel your boundaries are being crossed, feel free to use the safety tools in play to call attention to this and ask it to stop.   This is not a penalty or punishment, but a normal part of communication at the table.</li> <li>Ask first and also check in afterwards.   If you\u2019re not sure about something, like the kind of content the game will cover or how people will feel about your contribution, ask first what people think about it.   Even if you are sure about it, it can help to check first just in case.

Mistakes can happen, and it\u2019s up to all of us to act in good faith and rectify them.</li> <li>Be collaborative.   The games we play are often about working together with other players to tell a story.   Listen to others\u2019 input at the table, and when someone is stuck try and help them out if they are open to it.</li> <li>Share the spotlight.   Make sure everyone gets to have a moment to shine, and gets to be part of the group.   If you are the game\u2019s facilitator, you often have a wider overview of how the game is going, so take that opportunity to make sure everyone is involved in the game.</li> <li>Help ensure in-character conflict stays fun.   Some games pit players against each other.   But even then, make sure you are all on the same page about how the game handles player-versus-player interactions, and you can incorporate everyone\u2019s input in play.</li> <li>Lean in to the game and its tone.   Most games work best when everyone commits to the premise, genre, and tone.   It\u2019s okay if you need some time to warm up to it or get a feel for a game.</li> <li>Ask if you need help understanding a game\u2019s rules and mechanics.

If you have any additional needs, or would like a buddy to meet you to help you come along and enjoy yourself, please reach out to the Admin Team. You can find more information on how to reach us via our Contact page.</p>"},{"location":"resources/welcome-guide/#the-kind-of-games-we-play","title":"The Kind of Games We Play","text":"<p>As the name suggests, we are an Indie Games Club, and our events are story games meetups.</p> <p>Indie Games</p> <p>These are small press role-playing games, so not the ones that would be published by large commercial publishers. There are already a lot of spaces where those kinds of games are predominantly offered, so we spotlight a different selection instead.</p> <p>If you want to get more into the jargon, then the kinds of games we play include narrative games, Nordic-style games, diceless games, GMful and GMless games, PbTA games, et cetera. If none of these terms mean anything to you, that\u2019s fine too. There\u2019s no need to overthink this.</p> <p>Story Games</p> <p>These are games that are about collaborating to tell a story, as opposed to tactical wargames or the like. This is a wide brief, and covers a large number of games.</p> <p>Some examples of games that have run at the club in the past are Decaying Orbit, Dream Askew, For the Queen, Good Society, Monster of the Week, and Wanderhome. If you\u2019re still curious, and if you want to see detailed examples of how story games differ from other games, you could look up playthroughs or actual plays of these games on-line. But if you\u2019re not familiar with this, then that\u2019s okay too.</p> <p>We don\u2019t presume any degree of familiarity with tabletop role-playing, indie games, or any specific games.</p> <p>Additionally, many members of the club playtest their own games here as well! So you might end up playing something unique devised by a member of the club.</p>"},{"location":"resources/welcome-guide/#the-running-order","title":"The Running Order","text":"<p>The event starts at 6:00 pm. Member of the Admin Team will be present at the start of the event to welcome attendees, and will introduce themselves to participants. Feel free to speak to them over the course of the evening if you need help with anything.</p> <p>The first half-hour is the arrival time for everyone to get food or drinks or just catch up. While we don\u2019t start pitches until half-past, it\u2019s a good idea to arrive on time to make sure everything runs smoothly.</p> <p>As people arrive and as the events get started, members of the admin team will introduce themselves. If you have any issues, concerns, or questions, feel free to speak to them.</p> <p>6:00 pm to 6:30 pm: Arrival Time. 6:30 pm: Pitches; games start thereafter. 10:00 pm: Wrap up and close.</p> <p>During the pitches, people who have brought games to play will pitch the games (more information on how to pitch a game in the relevant section of the website). They will give a brief description of the game and how many players they can take.</p> <p>After everyone who has brought a game has pitched, people will be free to join the respective games. We normally give newcomers the first pick of a game of their choice, and then all returning members. Once games are filled, they can start and facilitators at each table take it from there.</p> <p>Games will run until shortly before 10 pm to allow everyone time to pack up and tidy.</p> <p>You are welcome to leave at any time. If a game is not working for you, if you have something else come up, or if you are just not feeling it, it\u2019s fine to leave (even if you are the game\u2019s facilitator).</p>"},{"location":"resources/welcome-guide/#using-the-venue","title":"Using the Venue","text":"<p>ShrubHub is a community space who have agreed to let us use their venue, and we want to be gracious guests here. They do let us bring in food and drink from outside, or use their cafe when it is staffed. But they have asked that our members tidy up after themselves when they are finished.</p> <p>Additionally, Shrub has a Safer Spaces Policy that they require people to abide by when using their space. Our Code of Conduct aligns with it, but it can be helpful to be familiar with it for good measure.</p>"},{"location":"resources/welcome-guide/#getting-help","title":"Getting Help","text":"<p>If you need help with anything, if you need to raise any concerns about the event, or if you have any feedback for the Club, please feel free to speak to members of the Admin Team at the event.
